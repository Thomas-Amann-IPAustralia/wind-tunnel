# Build status

## Current stage

**Stage 0 — Foundations** (PROJECT_BRIEF.md §9).

Scope: single-repo scaffold (TECH_SPEC §2), run-state model + run codes,
ingestion pipeline, one populated specialist KB end-to-end.

**Exit test:** a fetch/search returns pinpoint-cited chunks from a real corpus
doc. *Not yet met* — the corpus has landed, but the sidecars and the
ingestion/retrieval code don't exist yet.

## Done

- **Corpus `.meta.yml` sidecars authored — all 106 documents** (TECH_SPEC §8.6
  step 1, `corpus/README.md` template). One sidecar per document, seven fields
  each (`short_name`, `title`, `version`, `publisher`, `source_url`, `licence`,
  `redistributable`), named `<exact filename>.meta.yml`. `redistributable: true`
  on every file — **Tom (corpus owner) attested in-session that every document is
  cleared for use in the project**, discharging the licence-attestation that was
  Blocked-on-Tom. Metadata was researched per document (embedded docx/pdf/xlsx
  metadata + web verification); the ~50 CSIRO *Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue*
  entries under `solution_architect/` share provenance and are generated with
  `title`/`short_name` = pattern name. Validated: all parse as YAML, all seven
  fields present, `short_name` unique within each specialist (it is the citation
  key). Generator kept at `scratchpad/gen_sidecars.py` (not committed) and
  **asserts no document is left without a sidecar** — re-runnable/idempotent.
  This clears the licence hard gate's *input* for ingestion; see handoff notes
  for the licence-allow-list follow-up and the few best-effort fields.
- **Repo scaffold** matching TECH_SPEC §2 — every directory in the layout now
  exists with a `README.md` (structural dirs) or `.gitkeep` (code leaves)
  pointing to its governing tech-spec section.
- **`outline.md` moved to `templates/outline.md`** — the outline contract's
  home per TECH_SPEC §2 / §7.1 (it was loose at repo root). Header comment and
  section registry unchanged.
- **Committed non-secret config** (CLAUDE.md §6, TECH_SPEC §13):
  - `config/models.yml` — tier→role mapping transcribed from TECH_SPEC §13
    (decided); exact Gemini ids left as `TODO(Tom)` placeholders.
  - `config/retrieval.yml` — rewritten July 2026 for the index+fetch model:
    chunking targets, index token budget, fetch caps, search top-k. No
    embedding model, fusion weights, or reranker (see Decisions).
  - `config/budgets.yml` — per-stage call budgets + `expected_range_seconds`
    from the §13 worked example.
- **`prompts/manifest.yml`** — empty registry (`prompts: {}`) with the role list
  to author and the shape to follow (TECH_SPEC §9).
- **`pyproject.toml` for `backend/` and `pipeline/`** — Python 3.11, ruff +
  pytest config, empty pinned deps (conventions locked per CLAUDE.md §4).
- **`.gitignore`** — keeps env files and build cruft out; explicitly does *not*
  ignore `runs/` (durable store) or `kb/*.sqlite`.
- **`README.md`** — public-facing: what Windtunnel is, the usage warning,
  architecture, repo map, and orientation pointers.
- **Instrument source landed (Tom, July 2026)** —
  `instrument/guidance/AI_impact_assessment_tool.md` (the tool itself:
  questions, Table 1 likelihood scale, the real Table 2 risk matrix,
  per-section consequence tiers) and `Guidance_AI_impact_assessment_tool.md`
  (the guidance, including the risk-consequence appendix table). Encoding
  `instrument/*.json` is unblocked, and the rating engine can be built against
  the real Table 2 from the start — no scaffold matrix needed.
- **Corpus landed (Tom, July 2026)** — 106 documents across the six specialist
  folders, ~1.8M extractable tokens: it_security ~507K, ethics ~432K,
  privacy ~402K, legal ~220K, solution_architect ~163K (56 files, mostly the
  RAI pattern catalogue), data_governance ~73K. Formats: 58 docx / 37 pdf /
  12 md / 4 xlsx / 1 txt / 1 rtf. No `.meta.yml` sidecars yet.
- **Retrieval reevaluated against the real corpus; TECH_SPEC §8 rewritten**
  (this branch). The inherited embedding/hybrid design is replaced by an
  LLM-navigated structural index + `fetch`/`search` (FTS5 BM25) tool loop, and
  citations generalize from pages to typed locators. Documents updated
  together so none contradict (CLAUDE.md §2): TECH_SPEC (§2 layout, §6.3 event
  ref, §8 rewritten, §9.4, §13, §15, §16), PROJECT_BRIEF (framing, specialist
  contract, architecture table, Stage-0 exit test, citation-integrity risk),
  DESIGN_BRIEF (event table ref, report citation apparatus),
  `config/retrieval.yml`, `config/budgets.yml`, `corpus/README.md` (now carries
  the sidecar template), `kb/README.md`, CLAUDE.md §8.

## In progress / handoff notes

Sidecars are done (see Done). Next concrete steps toward the Stage 0 exit test,
in dependency order:

1. **Licence allow-list config** — the ingestion licence gate (§8.6 step 1)
   checks `redistributable: true` **and** `licence` ∈ allow-list. Sidecars now
   carry accurate licence strings, and while most are `CC-BY-4.0`, several are
   **not CC and must be added to the allow-list** for the gate to pass on Tom's
   attestation: `CC-BY-SA-4.0` (OWASP ×2, the CSIRO/NAIC RAI-tools report),
   `Public Domain (U.S. Government work)` (NIST SP 800-61r3, the NSA/CISA AI
   data-security & secure-deployment guidance), `UK Open Government Licence v3.0`
   (NCSC secure-AI-development guidelines), `OECD Terms and Conditions` (the OECD
   public-audit paper), `arXiv.org perpetual non-exclusive license` (QB4AIRA,
   Diversity & Inclusion in AI), `© American Bar Association …` (ABA Year-2
   report), `© University of Technology Sydney …` (HTI report), `© Bar Standards
   Board …` (UK BSB guidance), and `Internal – Commonwealth (IP Australia)` (the
   TRS guidance). Decide whether the allow-list enumerates these or the gate
   treats `redistributable: true` as sufficient given the owner's attestation.
2. **Instrument encoding** (`instrument/*.json`) — now unblocked: deterministic
   transcription from `instrument/guidance/*.md`, asserting at build time that
   every section maps to exactly one specialist owner (TECH_SPEC §6.2).
3. **Ingestion build** (`pipeline/retrieval/`, `.github/workflows/ingestion.yml`)
   to the revised TECH_SPEC §8: licence gate → structure-aware extraction
   (PyMuPDF for PDFs; docx style trees; xlsx normalization per §8.7) →
   structural chunking → index build → sqlite/index/manifest write. No
   embedding stack: deps stay small (pymupdf, openpyxl, pyyaml, stdlib sqlite3).
   The code can be written now; the licence gate now has its sidecar inputs
   (pending the allow-list decision in step 1).
4. **Rating engine** (`pipeline/rating/`) — against the **real** Table 2 now in
   the repo (TECH_SPEC §10); the scaffold-matrix contingency is obsolete.

Provenance corrections from Tom (July 2026) — the three documents whose sidecars
were originally inferred (they had no embedded title metadata) are now fixed to
Tom's sources:

- `ethics/TRS-GUIDANCE-AI-150925.pdf` — **The Research Society**, *AI Guidelines*
  (`https://www.researchsociety.com.au/member-resources/ai-guidelines/`). "TRS" =
  The Research Society. (Originally mis-inferred as internal IP Australia — the
  wrong guess is corrected in place.)
- `data_governance/Data-quality-checklist.pdf` — **National AI Centre**,
  *Strengthen data quality: data quality checklist*
  (`https://www.ai.gov.au/planning-ai/strengthen-data-quality`).
- `ethics/Guidance-for-AI-adoption-implementation-guidance_0_0.pdf` — **National
  AI Centre** (`https://www.ai.gov.au/staying-safe-and-responsible/essential-ai-practices/guidance-ai-adoption-implementation-guidance`).
  (Both had been attributed to the DTA; ai.gov.au is the National AI Centre site.)

Residual soft fields (not blocking, not inferred provenance): a few
`version`/`source_url` values are landing-page-level rather than the exact
document permalink (e.g. OAIC guideline consolidation date, some ASD publication
URLs), and `licence` strings assume the standard imprint (CC-BY-4.0 for
Commonwealth material) rather than a per-document imprint-page check. Tom's
attestation covers redistributability regardless.

Corpus observations for whoever builds ingestion (from the July 2026 review):

- All 37 PDFs have a real text layer — no OCR needed. The ISM PDF renders its
  controls as `Control: ISM-XXXX; …` lines (regexable into `record` chunks);
  the Privacy Act and Archives Act compilations are docx with full legislative
  styles (`ActHead*`, `subsection`) — provision anchors come from the style tree.
- Spreadsheet headers are one or two rows with merged group headers (cloud
  controls matrix `Principles` sheet; the pattern-mapping workbook) —
  normalization per §8.7 must detect header depth and fill down groupings.
- The ADM Better Practice Guide appears twice: `legal/…March-2025.pdf` and
  `ethics/apo-nid306481.pdf` (an earlier edition of the same guide). They now
  carry distinct `short_name`s (`ADM Better Practice Guide` vs
  `ADM Guide (earlier ed.)`) and live in different specialists, so KBs stay
  independent; Tom may still drop the stale copy. The earlier edition's exact
  `version` is unconfirmed (marked `earlier edition`).
- `legal/Artificial-Intelligence-Guidance-May-2026.pdf` is confirmed the **UK Bar
  Standards Board's** guidance (in force 18 May 2026) — Tom to confirm it's
  wanted alongside the AU material, or swap for an AU equivalent.
- `solution_architect/f4a6c658-en.pdf` is an **OECD** paper, *The state of AI in
  public audit* — an odd fit for the solution-architect corpus; Tom to confirm
  it belongs there (kept as placed).
- `The-new-machinery-of-government…pdf.pdf` has a doubled extension; harmless
  (doc_id slugging normalizes it). `placeholder.md` files can now be deleted —
  every folder holds real documents with sidecars.

## Decisions made (that the documents were silent on)

- **Directory-preservation convention:** structural directories get a
  `README.md` (which doubles as orientation); pure code-leaf directories that
  are otherwise empty get a `.gitkeep`. Chosen so git tracks the empty scaffold
  *and* the next instance finds a section pointer in each folder.
- **`.gitignore` allowlists `config/*.yml`** under the secrets block so the
  committed non-secret config is never accidentally ignored, while `.env*`
  stays excluded. `runs/` and `kb/*.sqlite` are deliberately **not** ignored —
  they are durable state / build outputs the repo is meant to hold.
- **Config files committed as scaffolds now** rather than deferred: they are
  non-secret and CLAUDE.md §6 names them as committed, so encoding the decided
  parts (tier→role, budget structure) and marking only the genuinely-open values
  `TODO(Tom)` gives the next instance a concrete starting point.
- **Retrieval = LLM-navigated index + fetch/search; no embeddings** (July 2026,
  after reviewing the landed corpus; full record TECH_SPEC §8.8). The corpora
  are small (≤~507K tokens/specialist) and registry-shaped; an in-context index
  gives specialists corpus awareness (better synthesis than top-k snippets),
  visible rather than silent recall failures, and zero ML infra in the runners.
  Reversible by construction: a dense channel can be added additively if
  Stage-3 quality testing shows recall gaps.
- **Citations anchor to typed locators, not only pages** (TECH_SPEC §8.2) —
  two-thirds of the corpus (docx/xlsx/md) has no true pages. PDFs keep the
  true-page guarantee; legislation cites provisions; sheets cite row ranges or
  record keys. The brief's citation-integrity intent is unchanged.
- **Spreadsheets ingest as normalized sheets classified by shape** (TECH_SPEC
  §8.7): instructions → prose; registries → row-group markdown chunks with
  `record_key`s; boolean matrices → per-row records naming only meaningful cells.
- **Sidecar `short_name` = citation key, unique per specialist** (not globally).
  KBs are per-specialist (§8.3), so uniqueness is only asserted within a folder;
  the CSIRO pattern entries use the pattern name as `short_name`, so a citation
  renders `[Fairness Assessor, §Benefits]`. Legislation cites by Act title
  (`[Privacy Act 1988, s 6]`), registries by their own short name (`[ISM, p.112]`).
  Chosen because these are the human-recognisable keys a reader would check.
- **`redistributable: true` on all 106 sidecars rests on Tom's in-session
  attestation**, not a per-document licence audit. The `licence` field still
  records the *actual* licence (CC-BY-4.0 for most Commonwealth material, plus
  CC-BY-SA / US public-domain / UK OGL / OECD / arXiv / ABA / UTS / BSB /
  IP-Australia-internal for the rest). The ingestion gate's allow-list must
  reconcile with these — see In progress step 1.

## Blocked on Tom

These block the *next* tasks (CLAUDE.md §8, TECH_SPEC §16). The instrument
source and Table 1/Table 2 landed July 2026 (see Done) and are no longer here:

- **~~`.meta.yml` sidecars with verified licences~~ — DONE (July 2026).** Tom
  attested in-session that every document is cleared for use, so all 106 sidecars
  are authored with `redistributable: true` and accurate `licence` strings (see
  Done). What remains from this item is a *config* decision, not a Tom blocker:
  the ingestion licence allow-list must accommodate the non-CC licences the
  sidecars record (In progress step 1). Tom's attestation is sufficient to
  progress; the three originally-inferred sidecars have been corrected to his
  sources (The Research Society; National AI Centre ×2 — see handoff notes).
- **Exact Gemini model identifiers** in `config/models.yml` — blocks the first
  real LLM call.

## Deploy-layer reminders (pinned in CLAUDE.md §9, not yet actioned)

Not blocking now, but they bite the moment anyone deploys: Render auto-deploy
OFF or watch-scoped to `backend/**`; SPA path-aware with hash routing and a
path-filtered `pages.yml`; backend commits via the GitHub Contents/Git-Data API,
not `git push`.
